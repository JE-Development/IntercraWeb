        <h1>Overview of Processing Activities</h1>
        The following overview summarizes the types of data processed and the purposes of their processing.
        <h1>Types of Processed Data</h1>
        • Third-party Tokens
        • Settings
        <h1>Purposes of Processing</h1>
        • User Comfort
        <h1>Applicable Legal Bases</h1>
        Below, we share the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations in your respective country of residence and domicile may apply. Additionally, specific legal bases may apply in individual cases, and we will inform you of those in the privacy policy.
        • Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) - The data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.
        • Contractual Performance and Pre-contractual Inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
        • Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.
        National Data Protection Regulations in Germany: In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national data protection regulations in Germany apply. This includes, in particular, the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG). The BDSG contains special provisions, in particular, regarding the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and transmission and automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for the purposes of the employment relationship (§ 26 BDSG), particularly with regard to the initiation, performance, or termination of employment relationships and the consent of employees. State data protection laws of the individual federal states may also apply.
        <h1>Transmission and Disclosure of Personal Data</h1>
        No personal data is collected. intercra.com offers the option to sign in with Google and Spotify. This is necessary to display personalized search results. The login information is not stored anywhere. Only the access token is temporarily stored to enable the use of some functions. The login is done directly through Google and Spotify, and intercra.com only receives the access token. Since no personal data is stored, nothing is transmitted to third parties. Search texts, login information, and user interests are not stored.
        Presence on Social Networks
        We have a presence on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, etc. This allows us to engage in marketing and establish a direct connection with users. This enables us to implement user requests and suggestions and seek feedback. No user data is analyzed or used for the presence on social networks.

        • Instagram
        • Twitter

        <h1>Deletion of Data</h1>
        The user has full control over their data, which is stored in cookies. Only the respective user-specific settings and tokens are stored. To delete the data, simply delete the cookies from intercra.com manually via the browser. No user data is stored in external databases or similar.

        • Right to Object: You have the right to object at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data concerning you, which is based on Art. 6(1)(e) or (f) GDPR; this also applies to profiling based on these provisions. If personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing; this also applies to profiling insofar as it is related to such direct marketing.
        • Right to Withdraw Consent: You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
        • Right to Information: You have the right to obtain confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and other relevant information.
        • Right to Rectification: You have the right to request the completion of incomplete personal data or the rectification of inaccurate personal data.
        • Right to Erasure and Restriction of Processing: You have the right, in accordance with legal requirements, to request the erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay or alternatively to request restriction of processing.
        • Right to Data Portability: You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller.
        • Right to Lodge a Complaint with a Supervisory Authority: You have the right, in accordance with legal requirements, to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, your place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.
        <h1>Definitions</h1>
        In this section, you will find an overview of the terminology used in this privacy policy. Many of the terms are taken from the law and are primarily defined in Art. 4 GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations are primarily intended to aid understanding. The terms are sorted alphabetically.
        • Personal Data: "Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g. cookie), or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.

        • Tracking: "Tracking" refers to the practice of following users' behavior across multiple online platforms. Behavior and interest information is often stored in cookies or on servers belonging to the providers of tracking technologies (profiling). This information can then be used to display advertisements to users that are likely to match their interests.
        • Controller: The "controller" is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
        • Processing: "Processing" means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means.

        Each webpage has been selected by intercra.com, and intercra.com uses crawling to display content from the respective webpages.
        The provider makes every effort to exclude content provided through Intercra.com that violates applicable laws or the rights of third parties. However, it is not always possible to achieve this result.
        <h1>Rights to Contents Available via intercra.com:</h1>
        All rights to the content are reserved by the provider.
        Users may only use the content to the extent necessary or implicitly provided for the proper use of the service.

        Where expressly indicated via intercra.com, users may download, reproduce, and/or distribute selected content available through intercra.com exclusively for personal and non-commercial purposes, provided that proper attribution and any other required notices from the provider are correctly applied.

        <h1>Access to External Resources:</h1>
        Users may access external resources provided by third parties via Intercra.com. Users acknowledge and accept that the provider has no control over such resources and therefore is not responsible for their content and availability.

        <h4>No Waiver:</h4>

        To ensure the best possible service, the provider reserves the right to interrupt the service for maintenance, system updates, or other changes.

        By continuing to use the service, the user accepts the amended terms and conditions. If users do not wish to be bound by the changes, they must discontinue using the service. If the revised conditions are not accepted, either party can terminate the agreement.
        For the relationship before the user's acceptance of the changes, the respective prior version of the terms and conditions shall apply. The user can obtain any previous version of the terms and conditions from the provider.
